Numlib.NET
==========

A small numerical library written in C#
Right now it only contains simple matrices and vector classes, sorting and searching algorithms, 
and some linear algebra algorithms.

My to do list:
- Write more complete linear algebra algorithms.
- Write algorithms for solving differential equations.
- Statistical routines.
- write an interface to BLAS and LAPACK.
